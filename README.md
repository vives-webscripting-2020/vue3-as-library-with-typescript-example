# Vue 3 as library with TypeScript

This is a minimal example project showing how to use Vue 3 as library with TypeScript.

It uses Webpack to bundle the Vue code with your own code in a single `bundle.js` file.

## Try it out

First you need to install all the dependencies.

```cli
npm install
```

You can build the code with the following command:

```cli
npm run build
```

If you want to play with the code and have automatic recompile using watch functionality, you can use:

```cli
npm run watch
```

Now use your favorite HTTP server and browse to the website.
